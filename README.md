Pattern Lab
==
Pattern Lab is a collection of tools to help create and maintain atomic web design systems.

## The1stMovement Version
We have restructured the folders to better fit our standard process. We have also re-factored the SCSS to reflect a more modular approach to Brad Frost's Atomic Design concept. The new pattern also reflects concepts discussed by Robin Rendle, with our own twists. We expect this to become a living standard for our agency going forward, so expect changes to potentially be either drastic or simple depending on our experiences.

## Atomic Design
All matter, no matter how complex, can be broken down into molecules which can be broken down further into atomic elements. All web interfaces can be broken down down the same way.  Atomic Design provides a methodology for building an effective design system. It consists of five distinct stages: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages.
